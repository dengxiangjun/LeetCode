/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/description/
 * Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.
 * <p>
 * Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":
 * <p>
 * great
 * /    \
 * gr    eat
 * / \    /  \
 * g   r  e   at
 * / \
 * a   t
 * To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.
 * <p>
 * For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".
 * <p>
 * rgeat
 * /    \
 * rg    eat
 * / \    /  \
 * r   g  e   at
 * / \
 * a   t
 * We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".
 * <p>
 * Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".
 * <p>
 * rgtae
 * /    \
 * rg    tae
 * / \    /  \
 * r   g  ta  e
 * / \
 * t   a
 * We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".
 * <p>
 * Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.
